Record some ideas that I may complete the implementation in the future.

# Vocabulary Assistance
running in CLI like this

{% highlight bash %}
# VocAss [word] [meanings]
{% endhighlight %}

and it will build an index in the database in alphabetical order.

when you want to make a review,you can do this

{% highlight bash %}
# VocAss list 'A' [number]
{% endhighlight %}
and it will show indexed vocabularies in the given amount.

or you can let it randomly pick some vocabularies for you like this

{% highlight bash %}
# VocAss randlist  [number]
{% endhighlight %}
