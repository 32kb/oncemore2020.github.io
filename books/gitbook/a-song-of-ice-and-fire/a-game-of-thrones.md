![cover](../pics/a-song-of-ice-and-fire/a-game-of-thrones.jpg)

## Chapter 1. BRAN
**0x0000**. Bran 和 Ned关于恐惧和勇气的对话
> Bran thought about it. “Can a man still be brave if he’s afraid?”
>
>“That is the only time a man can be brave,” his father told him.

**0x0001**. Ned 向 Bran解释为什么要亲自对叛逃的守夜人Gared行刑
> "A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is."

## Chapter 5. JON
**0x0002**. Tyrion 对 JON 传授的一点`人生的经验`
> "Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you."

## Chapter 9. TYRION
**0x0003**. Tyrion 表示纵使残疾，也比死了好，因为生命也充满了无限的可能性
> "Speaking for the grotesques, I beg to differ. Death is so terribly final, while life is full of possibilities."

## Chapter 10. JON
**0x0004**. Jon 因为看望 Bran 时 Catelyn 对其偏见过重，对 Robb 说了句气话，没想到...这也侧面表现出 **"You know NOTHING, Jon Snow."** ，哈哈哈哈哈
> "You Starks are hard to kill."

**0x0005**. 离开临冬城前 Jon 安慰 Arya 的话，意思就是殊途同归吧
> "Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle. Who knows"

## Chapter 11. DAENERYS
**0x0006**. 一开始 Jorah 就警告了 Daenerys 的傻哥哥 Viserys，结果后者不信邪
> "A lesser man may beg a favor from the khal, but must never presume to berate him."

## Chapter 12. EDDARD
**0x0007**. Ned 的无奈
> A man could not always be where he belonged, though.

## Chapter 13. TYRION
**0x0008**. 知易行难就是这样
> Tyrion Lannister knew the maps as well as anyone, but a fortnight on the wild track that passed for the kingsroad up here had brought home the lesson that the map was one thing and the land quite another.

**0x0009**. Tyrion 觉得 Jon 选择了困难模式
> He had chosen a hard life... or perhaps he should say that a hard life had been chosen for him.

**0x000a**. Tyrion 演绎如何使用 **0x0002** , 哈哈哈哈哈
> "No doubt you’ll find some place to put me, As you might have noticed, I’m small."

**0x000b**. 兵来将挡，水来土掩？
> The Lannisters never declined, graciously or otherwise. The Lannisters took what was offered.

**0x000c**. Tyrion 向 Jon 解释为什么他要读这么多书，太有道理了
> "Fourteen, and you’re taller than I will ever be. My legs are short and twisted, and I walk with difficulty. I require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse. A saddle of my own design, you may be interested to know. It was either that or ride a pony. My arms are strong enough, but again, too short. I will never make a swordsman. Had I been born a peasant, they might have left me out to die, or sold me to some slaver’s grotesquerie. Alas, **I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock**, and the grotesqueries are all the poorer. **Things are expected of me.** My father was the Hand of the King for twenty years. My brother later killed that very same king, as it turns out, but life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after him. **I must do my part for the honor of my House**, wouldn’t you agree? Yet how? Well, my legs may be too small for my body, but **my head is too large, although I prefer to think it is just large enough for my mind**. **I have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses**. **My mind is my weapon**. My brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer, and **I have my mind... and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge**. That’s why I read so much, Jon Snow."

**0x000d**. Tyrion 早在童年就对龙心驰神往，也为后面投奔龙女做了铺垫
> "Even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the world when he’s seated on a dragon’s back."

**0x000e**. 前半句给 Tyrion 弑父埋下伏笔，后半句可能是在呼应巫魔女给 Cersei 下的预言(参考[巫魔女的预言](http://zh.asoiaf.wikia.com/wiki/%E7%91%9F%E6%9B%A6%C2%B7%E5%85%B0%E5%B0%BC%E6%96%AF%E7%89%B9))，但另一说是 Cersei 可能会被 Jaime 杀死
> "Sometimes I’d imagine my father burning. At other times, my sister."

**0x000f**. 鼓励 Jon 面对事实(守夜人和想象中真的不一样)
> "That’s good, bastard. Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it."

**0x0010**. 去黑城堡的路上，GRRM 采用 Tyrion 而不是 Jon 的 POV 来写，从侧面表现 Jon 多么无助
> The boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep into the flames.
Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed.

## Chapter 14. CATELYN
**0x0011**. Tully 家族的族训 **Family, duty, honer.** 里把 Family 放在第一位置
> "My son lies here broken and dying, Luwin, and you wish to discuss a new master of *horse*? Do you think I care what happens in the stables? Do you think it matters to me one whit? I would gladly butcher every horse in Winterfell with my own hands if it would open Bran’s eyes, do you understand that? *Do you*?"

## Chapter 15. SANSA
**高能预警**：本节主要突出恋爱中的 Sansa 智商为零和自带婊性这两个事实

**0x0012**. GRRM 把 *know* 加斜了，呵呵
> Sansa did not really *know* Joffrey yet, but she was already in love with him.

**0x0013**. 醒醒吧！少女！
> All she wanted was for things to be nice and pretty, the way they were in the songs.

**0x0014**. Arya 表示要去骑马时 Sansa 作为一个淑女表示了对骑马的厌恶，注意作者把 *hate* 加斜了
> "I *hate* riding, All it does is get you soiled and dusty and sore.”

但是稍后 Joffrey 邀请她去骑马时，Sansa 对骑马的态度直接180度转弯，注意作者把 *love* 也加斜了，应该就是为了做个对比吧，哈哈哈哈哈
> "Oh, I *love* riding,"

## Chapter 16. EDDARD
**0x0015**. 无官一身轻？
> He would have run, but he was still the King’s Hand, and a Hand must keep his dignity.

**0x0016**. Ned 早知道真相，所以才有动怒的底气，但是没想到 Sansa 如此坑爹
> Ned had heard her version of the story the night Arya had vanished. He knew the truth.

**0x0017**. Sansa 坑爹，当 Ned 希望她说出真相时
> “I don’t know,” she said tearfully, looking as though she wanted to bolt. “I don’t remember. Everything happened so fast, I didn’t see...”

意识到自己要背锅时，又把所有错怪罪到 Arya 身上
> “Stop them,” Sansa pleaded, “don’t let them do it, please, please, it wasn’t Lady, it was Nymeria, Arya did it, you can’t, it wasn’t Lady, don’t let them hurt Lady, I’ll make her be good, I promise, I promise...” She started to cry.

真想对 Sansa 说一句《教父》里 Michael 对他哥哥 Fredo 说的话: **"Never take sides with anybody against the family, NEVER."**

**0x0018**. 印证 **0x0001** 里 Ned 关于统治者的价值观
> “Do it yourself then, Robert,” he said in a voice cold and sharp as steel. “At least have the courage to do it yourself.”

**0x0019**. Ned 真的是个有规矩的好人...无论对人还是对狼行刑，都要按照老规矩用寒冰，然后还要派四个人送狼尸体回临冬城，四个人啊！(这一部分在电视剧里没有描述)
> When it was over, he said, “Choose four men and have them take the body north. Bury her at Winterfell.”

## Chapter 17. BRAN
**0x001a**. Bran 必须活下去的原因，感觉这是 GRRM 给的免死金牌啊，书里面能得到这个待遇的人恐怕就只有 Bran 一人了吧
> *Now you know*, the crow whispered as it sat on his shoulder. *Now you know why you must live*.
>
> “Why?” Bran said, not understanding, falling, falling.
>
> *Because winter is coming*.

## Chapter 18. CATELYN
**0x001b**. Catelyn 对少年小指头的看法，是 **clever** 而不是 **wise**，虽然表示多年不见，但仍看得出对小指头过于轻视，这很大程度上促成了 Stark 家族的灾难
> "He was always clever, even as a boy, but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise. I wonder what the years have done to him."

## Chapter 19. JON
**0x001c**. Jon 加入守夜人时是在第15个命名日前不久，毕竟还是太年轻
> No one had told him the Night’s Watch would be like this; no one except Tyrion Lannister. The dwarf had given him the truth on the road north, but by then it had been too late. Jon wondered if his father had known what the Wall would be like. He must have, he thought; that only made it hurt the worse.

**0x001d**. Benjen 叔叔告诉 Jon ，他毕竟还是 `Too young, too simple, sometimes naive.`
> “On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns. You’re no ranger, Jon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you.”

没想到啥都不懂的 Jon 还真以为叔叔在跟他说literally的年龄问题，哈哈哈
> Stupidly, Jon argued. "I'll be fifteen on my name day," he said. "Almost a man grown."

**0x001e**. Jon 对宗教也产生了质疑
> If they were real, he thought, they were as cruel and implacable as winter.

**0x001f**. 处处都是伏笔，黑城堡铁匠告诫 Jon 不要以为练武赢了一些菜鸟就能`搞个大新闻`
> “A long life or a short one, it’s up to you, Snow. The road you’re walking, one of your brothers will slit your throat for you one night.”

**0x0020**. Tyrion 由长城想到的感悟，自动脑补到我国的绝境长城-GFW
> “As I was saying... why is it that when one man builds a wall, the next man immediately needs to know what’s on the other side?”

**0x0021**. Tyrion 再次演绎**0x0002**
> “Would you rather be called the Imp? Let them see that their words can cut you, and you’ll never be free of the mockery. If they want to give you a name, take it, make it your own. Then they can’t hurt you with it anymore.”

## Chapter 20. EDDARD
**0x0022**. Ned 在 Catelyn 返回临冬城前嘱咐的安排，可以看出 Ned 在战争方面毕竟还是`身经百战`了，虽然其政治智商比较低
> "Once you are home, send word to Helman Tallhart and Galbart Glover under my seal. They are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify Moat Cailin. Two hundred determined archers can hold the Neck against an army. Instruct Lord Manderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at White Harbor, and see that they are well manned. And from this day on, I want a careful watch kept over Theon Greyjoy. If there is war, we shall have sore need of his father’s fleet."

## Chapter 21. TYRION
**0x0023**. Tyrion 任性羞辱 Alliser 骑士
> "If a man paints a target on his chest, he should expect that sooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him."

**0x0024**. Tyrion 经常黑别人的原因
> "We all need to be mocked from time to time, Lord Mormont, lest we start to take ourselves too seriously."

**0x0025**. Tyrion 回城前向熊老表示可以派 Jon 保护他，Jon 便有机会回临冬城看看
> "You might send young Snow. He would be glad for a chance to see his brothers."

但是熊老断然拒绝，`守夜人的职责就是战斗`
> "The young ones need to forget the lives they left behind them, the brothers and mothers and all that."

**0x0026**. Robert、Tywin 和 Jaime 的表现对比很有意思
> "I promise, the king will hear of your need," Tyrion said gravely, “and I will speak to my father and my brother Jaime as well.” And he would. Tyrion Lannister was as good as his word. He left the rest unsaid; that King Robert would ignore him, Lord Tywin would ask if he had taken leave of his senses, and Jaime would only laugh.

**0x0027**. Jon 这句话好屌啊，哈哈哈，但是没想到当前真正的威胁不在长城北边，而是在长城南边
> "Tell Robb that I’m going to command the Night’s Watch and keep him safe, so he might as well take up needlework with the girls and have Mikken melt down his sword for horseshoes."

## Chapter 22. ARYA
**0x0028**. Ned 对 Arya 说的，很有道理
> "When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives. Summer is the time for squabbles. In winter, we must protect one another, keep each other warm, share our strengths."

## Chapter 23. DAENERYS
**0x0029**. 维斯特洛大陆的百姓不会关心谁在权力的游戏中取胜，当然也不会希望 Viserys 回君临`当总书记`
> "The common people pray for rain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends," Ser Jorah told her. "It is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones, so long as they are left in peace." He gave a shrug. "they never are."

## Chapter 25. EDDARD
**0x002a**. Ned 就是不信邪，轻信别人，这句话是小指头说给他的，真假虚实确难判断
> "You are slow to learn, Lord Eddard. Distrusting me was the wisest thing you’ve done since you climbed down off your horse."

## Chapter 26. JON
**0x002b**. 回想起 Tyrion对自己说过的话 (**0x000f**)，Jon 觉得 Sam 也算是有点勇气
> The world was full of cravens who pretended to be heroes; it took a queer sort of courage to admit to cowardice as Samwell Tarly had.

**0x002c**. 说起做事情，Jon 也算是有手段有胆识，那他啥都不懂的是什么呢?
> Jon persuaded some, cajoled some, shamed the others, made threats where threats were required.

**0x002d**. Jon 在心理上完成了从临冬城私生子到守夜人的转变
> The grey walls of Winterfell might still haunt his dreams, but Castle Black was his life now, and his brothers were Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs who wore the black of the Night’s Watch.

## Chapter 29. SANSA
**0x002e**. Sansa 太傻
> At first she thought she hated him for what they’d done to Lady, but after Sansa had wept her eyes dry, she told herself that it had not been Joffrey’s doing, not truly. The queen had done it; she was the one to hate, her and Arya. Nothing bad would have happened except for Arya.

**0x002f**. 这一段在剧集中没有，Jaime 日子确实不好过啊
> Jaime Lannister put a hand on the king’s shoulder, but the king shoved him away hard. Lannister stumbled and fell. The king guffawed. “The great knight. I can still knock you in the dirt. Remember that, Kingslayer.” He slapped his chest with the jeweled goblet, splashing wine all over his satin tunic. “Give me my hammer and not a man in the realm can stand before me!”
>
> Jaime Lannister rose and brushed himself off. “As you say, Your Grace.” His voice was stiff.

**0x0030**. 猎狗喷 Sansa, 哈哈哈哈哈
> "Some septa trained you well. You’re like one of those birds from the Summer Isles, aren’t you? A pretty little talking -bird, repeating all the pretty little words they taught you to recite."

**0x0031**. 直到这一句话，开始发现猎狗已经对 Sansa 产生了情愫，喝醉了酒，把自己的秘密直接就说给 Sansa 听了
> "Pretty little talking girl, you believe that, you’re empty-headed as a bird for true."

当然这也有可能是 Sansa 在猎狗面前提起了他哥哥魔山引起的，但后面感觉并不是这么简单。猎狗坐在 Sansa 面前，显得好无助啊，按这样子发展下去差点以为有羞羞的事要发生了...
> The rasping voice trailed off. He squatted silently before her, a hulking black shape shrouded in the night, hidden from her eyes.

这一章可以算是猎狗和 Sansa 感情线的开始

## Chapter 30. EDDARD
**0x0032**. Barristan 这句话很有道理，告诉我们喝了酒不要乱说话
> "They say night’s beauties fade at dawn, and the children of wine are oft disowned in the morning light."

**0x0033**. Robert 也是惨，发现铁王座不是那么好坐
> "I swear to you, I was never so alive as when I was winning this throne, or so dead as now that I’ve won it."

Cersei 也对其性冷淡
> "Oh, Cersei is lovely to look at, truly, but cold... the way she guards her cunt, you’d think she had all the gold of Casterly Rock between her legs."

并且知道他儿子在撒谎，但是却无可奈何
> "I am sorry for your girl, Ned. Truly. About the wolf, I mean. My son was lying, I’d stake my soul on it."

想出去放空自己吧，又咽不下这口气
> "You know what stops me? The thought of Joffrey on the throne, with Cersei standing behind him whispering in his ear. My son. How could I have made a son like that, Ned?"

**0x0034**. 继续炒Sansa&Hound线，Sansa 为什么要为猎狗着急呢，之前不是表现过对外人并不关心了吗
> Wood shattered, and the Hound reeled, fighting to keep his seat. **Sansa gasped.**

**0x0035**. `你还是另请高明吧`，这个小伙子的选择其实非常明智，如果加入国王之手护卫队，后面不是被杀就是加入守夜人，再无其他出路
> Ned sent Alyn to seek him out and offer him a position with the Hand’s guard, but the boy was flush with wine and victory and riches undreamed of, and he refused.

**0x0036**. Robert 在政治局里面被完全架空
> "His brothers hate the Lannisters, true enough, but hating the queen and loving the king are not quite the same thing, are they? Ser Barristan loves his honor, Grand Maester Pycelle loves his office, and Littlefinger loves Littlefinger."

**0x0037**. Ned 太过于追求真相而没有果断下手防范，很大程度上导致了其倒台。
> Ned’s head was pounding. "Why? Why now? Jon Arryn had been Hand for fourteen years. What was he doing that they had to kill him?"
>
> "Asking questions," Varys said, slipping out the door.

## Chapter 31. TYRION
**0x0038**. **A Lannister always paid his debts.**
> Tyrion had made a special effort to learn all their names, so he might thank them later for their tender treatment of him. A Lannister always paid his debts.

**0x0039**. 大家对小指头的评价都不高，不知道为什么Stark一家还傻傻分不清楚
> "Because it is his nature. Lying comes as easily as breathing to a man like Littlefinger."

> "Littlefinger has never loved anyone but Littlefinger, and I promise you that it is not your hand that he boasts of, it’s those ripe breasts of yours, and that sweet mouth, and the heat between your legs."

**0x003a**. 好想知道这到底是不是真的
> "Why, every man at court has heard him tell how he took your maidenhead, my lady."

**0x003b**. Bronn的这句话极具煽动性！！！
> "Nothing like a woman after a man’s been blooded, take my word."

**0x003c**. 这句话这么有道理，Catelyn就是听不进去啊，总之Stark一家都是戴着有色眼镜看Lannister一家的。另一方面，也反映出Tyrion和Jaime的兄弟情深
> "There is a serious flaw in Littlefinger’s fable. Whatever you may believe of me, Lady Stark, I promise you this- I never bet against my family."

## Chapter 32. ARYA
**0x003d**. 恐惧比利剑更伤人
> Fear cuts deeper than swords.

**0x003e**. 看来其他人真不是当着Stark的人在黑小指头，小指头太狡猾了
> "Littlefinger... the gods only know what game Littlefinger is playing."

## Chapter 33. EDDARD
**0x003f**. Barristan 说的话不多，但都充满正义感且满含哲理
> "Your Grace, there is honor in facing an enemy on the battlefield, but none in killing him in his mother’s womb."

**0x0040**. Ned的统治观，同**0x0001**和**0x0018**
> "Do it yourself, Robert. The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. Look her in the eyes before you kill her. See her tears, hear her last words. You owe her that much at least."

**0x0041**. 既然这么想，为啥还傻傻地跟着小指头去妓院找Robert的私生子,唉。。。
> And when you have it, what then? Some secrets are safer kept hidden. Some secrets are too dangerous to share, even with those you love and trust.

**0x0042**. 小指头极尽讽刺之能，其实后面Ned死得也一点都不noble
> "You rule like a man dancing on rotten ice. I daresay you will make a noble splash."

## Chapter 34. CATELYN
**0x0043**. 好人当久了，想法太单一，Cat犯的错确实挺多的
> Could I be wrong? Catelyn wondered, not for the first time.

**0x0044**. 因为不是POV，目前尿遁鱼的性格只能从第三者眼里了解些许
> Brynden Tully had always known how to listen... to anyone but her father.

**0x0045**. 可是冰与火世界里有多少贵族的婚姻是真爱呢，呵呵
> Lord Arryn was a dutiful husband, but their marriage was made from politics, not passion.

**0x0046**. 不黑不喷，Tyrion对Jaime、Tywin和Cersei的评价非常到位
> "My brother is undoubtedly arrogant," Tyrion Lannister replied. "My father is the soul of avarice, and my sweet sister Cersei lusts for power with every waking breath. I, however, am innocent as a little lamb. Shall I bleat for you?"

## Chapter 35. EDDARD
**0x0047**. Lyanna 也不笨嘛
> "Love is sweet, dearest Ned, but it cannot change a man’s nature."

**0x0048**. 这个问题好深奥...
> If the gods frowned so on bastards, he thought dully, why did they fill men with such lusts?

**0x0049**. 在Ned眼里，Rhaegar 的人品显然没有Robert说的那么糟糕，关键是如果他真的强暴了自己的妹妹，Ned还会这么想吗？所以关于Rhaegar和Lyanna之间的事情，可能并不是Robert说的那么简单
> For the first time in years, he found himself remembering Rhaegar Targaryen. He wondered if Rhaegar had frequented brothels; somehow he thought not.

## Chapter 36. DAENERYS
**0x004a**. 只能说Viserys有时候笨得萌萌哒，自己的骑士都要这样黑他
> "Viserys could not sweep a stable with ten thousand brooms."

**0x004b**. Dothraki和维斯特洛大陆人的作战观具有鲜明对比，就和中国历史上塞外民族和汉人的作战观的不同
> "Your khal would tell you that only a coward hides behind stone walls instead of facing his enemy with a blade in hand."

## Chapter 37. BRAN
**0x004c**. 由愚蠢或绝望所生的行为，彼此常常难以区分
> "Folly and desperation are ofttimes hard to tell apart."

## Chapter 38. TYRION
**0x004d**. 霸气!
> "I made no threats," Tyrion said. "That was a promise."

**0x004e**. 不止一次写到Tyrion对家人的看法，反而显得真实而客观
> His sister was not without a certain low cunning, but her pride blinded
her.

> His brother never untied a knot when he could slash it in two with his sword.

Joffrey这么做死，可能也是继承了他父母两人的人格缺陷所致。

**0x004f**. 书读得多就是不一样! 狮狼两家这么多人，Tyrion是第一个察觉到有第三方势力在背后制造阴谋的
> Perhaps the direwolf and the lion were not the only beasts in the woods, and if that was true, someone was using him as a catspaw.

**0x0050**. 文盲也要分两种，很恰当
> Some illiterates held writing in disdain; others seemed to have a superstitious reverence for the written word, as if it were some sort of magic.

## Chapter 40. CATELYN
**0x0051**. 政治婚姻害人啊，当然Lysa自己傻也占很大的原因
> Lysa’s policies varied with her moods, and her moods changed hourly. The shy girl she had known at Riverrun had grown into a woman who was by turns proud, fearful, cruel, dreamy, reckless, timid, stubborn, vain, and, above all, inconstant.

**0x0052**. 细节：Vardis骑士在和Bronn比武用的剑居然是Jon Arryn生前的佩剑，而不是自己的剑！Lysa真的是做大死。。。
> The engraved silver blade was beautiful beyond a doubt, but it seemed to Catelyn that Ser Vardis might have been more comfortable with his own sword.

**0x0053**. Cat回忆起的这场比斗当然是Brandon和小指头的那场比武。。。哎，感觉Cat对小指头还是心怀愧疚，这种复杂感情被小指头把握得很好并且加以利用
> And as she watched, the memory of another duel in another time came back to Catelyn Stark, as vivid as if it had been yesterday.

## Chapter 41. Jon
**0x0054**. Jon讲道理说Sam永远也使不来剑，从这句话开始，发现Jon的思维能力很强，说话也很有逻辑
> "Lord Randyll couldn’t make Sam a warrior, and Ser Alliser won’t either. You can’t hammer tin into iron, no matter how hard you beat it, but that doesn’t mean tin is useless."

**0x0055**. 紧接着上一句，表示Sam身上也有闪光点，能创造价值，这表达能力真的是杠杠的
> "The Night’s Watch needs every man. Why kill one, to no end? Make use of him instead."

**0x0056**. 感觉Aemon学士也对Jon刮目相看，原来这个小伙子这么能说。。。。
> "Maester Luwin taught you well, Jon Snow. Your mind is as deft as your blade, it would seem."
